# Secret-Sharing-Bomb-Activation

A Java console application simulating secret sharing and bomb activation using basic cryptographic principles. Participants (key holders) possess secret keys generated by mathematical operations. The bomb activates only when a specified minimum number of keys are combined with correct values.

## Features

- Interactive input for any number of key holders and number of keys required to activate the bomb (`n` and `k`)
- Supports various operations to generate keys: sum, multiplier, gcd, hcf, lcm, or direct number input
- Validates user-entered custom key values with warnings for mismatches
- Allows user to select a subset of keys to reconstruct the secret
- Displays an equation showing selected keys (like `y = P1 + P4 + ...`)
- User inputs values for selected keys; program verifies if the sum matches expected secret
- Activates bomb with a dramatic countdown and "BOOM!" message on success
- Detects fake or incorrect keys and reports failures clearly
- Robust input validation throughout

## How to Run

1. Compile the program:

2. Run the program:

3. Follow the prompts to:
- Enter total number of key holders (`n`) and minimum keys to activate (`k`)
- Enter each key holderâ€™s name, operation type, and operands
- Optionally override keys with custom values
- Select keys for secret reconstruction
- Enter values for selected keys to verify and activate bomb

## Example Interaction


## How It Works

- The secret key for each participant is generated via the specified operation.
- To activate the bomb, at least `k` participants combine their keys.
- The program uses polynomial interpolation behind the scenes to reconstruct the secret from any valid subset of keys.
- The user inputs values for chosen keys and the program validates correctness by comparing sums.
- On successful validation, a countdown and activation message simulate the bomb detonation.
- Incorrect or fake keys are detected and reported to prevent unauthorized activation.
